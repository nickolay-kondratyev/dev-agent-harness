# ContextForAgentProvider / ap.9HksYVzl1KkR9E1L2x8Tx.E

Assembles instruction files for agents. Each agent receives a single Markdown file containing
everything it needs — role definition, ticket, shared context, prior agent outputs, and
communication tooling. The provider is the **single place** that decides what each agent sees.

Renamed from `ContextProvider` to `ContextForAgentProvider` to avoid ambiguity — "context" is
overloaded in this codebase (`ShepherdContext`, etc.).

---

## Why It Exists

Agents run in isolated TMUX sessions with no shared memory. Their only input is the instruction
file sent via `send-keys`. Getting the right content into that file — and keeping irrelevant
content out — is critical for agent effectiveness. The provider centralizes this assembly so
`PartExecutor` (ref.ap.fFr7GUmCYQEV5SJi8p6AS.E) doesn't need to know the concatenation rules.

---

## Interface

```kotlin
enum class AgentRole { DOER, REVIEWER, PLANNER, PLAN_REVIEWER }

interface ContextForAgentProvider {

    /**
     * Assembles the instruction file for an agent.
     * `role` selects the section plan; `request` supplies all data needed by any role.
     * Writes to `request.outputDir/instructions.md`. Returns the written path.
     */
    suspend fun assembleInstructions(role: AgentRole, request: UnifiedInstructionRequest): Path
}
```

Single public method. The executor passes `role` — no longer needs to know which of four methods
to call, making it impossible to call the wrong one. Adding a new agent role requires only a new
`AgentRole` variant and a plan list, not a new interface method + request type.

### UnifiedInstructionRequest

```kotlin
data class UnifiedInstructionRequest(
    // ── common (all roles) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    val roleDefinition: RoleDefinition,
    val ticketContent: String,
    val iterationNumber: Int,
    val outputDir: Path,
    val publicMdOutputPath: Path,

    // ── execution agents (DOER + REVIEWER) ────────────────────────────────────
    val partName: String? = null,
    val partDescription: String? = null,
    val planMdPath: Path? = null,              // null → no-planning workflow
    val priorPublicMdPaths: List<Path> = emptyList(),

    // ── DOER-only ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    val reviewerPublicMdPath: Path? = null,    // null on iteration 1

    // ── REVIEWER-only ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    val doerPublicMdPath: Path? = null,
    val feedbackDir: Path? = null,

    // ── PLANNER-only ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    val roleCatalogEntries: List<RoleCatalogEntry> = emptyList(),
    val planReviewerPublicMdPath: Path? = null, // null on iteration 1
    val planJsonOutputPath: Path? = null,
    val planMdOutputPath: Path? = null,

    // ── PLAN_REVIEWER-only ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    val planJsonContent: String? = null,
    val planMdContent: String? = null,
    val plannerPublicMdPath: Path? = null,
    val priorPlanReviewerPublicMdPath: Path? = null, // null on iteration 1
)
```

Role-specific fields are `null` (or empty list) when not applicable. The `role` parameter is the
discriminator — the provider accesses only the fields relevant to the given role. Unused fields
are visible from the grouping comments above.

---

## Instruction File Content — By Agent Type

Each role defines its section sequence as an `InstructionPlan` — a `List<InstructionSection>`.
A single internal `assembleFromPlan(plan: List<InstructionSection>, request: UnifiedInstructionRequest)`
walks the plan and renders each section. State-dependent sections (e.g. `iterationNumber > 1`)
are modeled as conditional section types within the plan, not as conditionals scattered across
role-specific template methods.

## Internal Design: Data-Driven Assembly

The four public methods share a single rendering engine. Only the section list (the
"plan") differs per role.

### InstructionSection (sealed class)

Each logical content block is one `InstructionSection` subtype:

| Section type | Description |
|---|---|
| `RoleDefinition` | Full `.md` file for the role from `$TICKET_SHEPHERD_AGENTS_DIR` |
| `PartContext` | Part `name` and `description` from `current_state.json` |
| `Ticket` | Ticket markdown file content |
| `PlanMd` | `shared/plan/PLAN.md` — always included for `with-planning` workflows; absent for straightforward workflows |
| `PriorPublicMd` | Prior completed PUBLIC.md files per [Visibility Rules](#visibility-rules) |
| `DoerOutputForReview` | Doer's current PUBLIC.md — reviewer only |
| `StructuredFeedbackFormat` | Static structured-feedback format instruction — reviewer only |
| `AddressedFeedback` | `__feedback/addressed/*.md` — reviewer, iteration > 1 |
| `RejectedFeedback` | `__feedback/rejected/*.md` — reviewer, iteration > 1 |
| `RemainingOptionalFeedback` | `__feedback/pending/optional__*.md` — reviewer, iteration > 1 |
| `FeedbackWritingInstructions` | Static instructions for writing feedback files — reviewer only |
| `IterationFeedback` | Reviewer's PUBLIC.md + pushback guidance — doer, iteration > 1 |
| `FeedbackItem` | Single feedback file + resolution instructions (ADDRESSED/REJECTED/SKIPPED) — doer inner-loop only (ref.ap.5Y5s8gqykzGN1TVK5MZdS.E) |
| `RoleCatalog` | All role definitions (name + description) — planner only |
| `AvailableAgentTypes` | Supported agent types + models — planner and plan-reviewer |
| `PlanFormatInstructions` | JSON schema for `plan_flow.json` — planner only |
| `PlannerFeedback` | Plan reviewer's PUBLIC.md — planner, iteration > 1 |
| `PlanFlowJsonOutputPath` | Absolute path to `harness_private/plan_flow.json` — planner only |
| `PlanMdOutputPath` | Absolute path to `shared/plan/PLAN.md` — planner only |
| `PlanFlowJsonContent` | Read `harness_private/plan_flow.json` — plan-reviewer only |
| `PlanMdContent` | Read `shared/plan/PLAN.md` — plan-reviewer only |
| `PlannerPublicMd` | Planner's PUBLIC.md — plan-reviewer only |
| `PlanReviewerPriorFeedback` | Plan reviewer's own prior PUBLIC.md — plan-reviewer, iteration > 1 |
| `PublicMdOutputPath` | Computed output path for the agent's PUBLIC.md |
| `WritingGuidelines` | Static PUBLIC.md writing guidance |
| `CallbackHelp` | Compaction-survival callback script usage (role-specific done signal) |

### InstructionPlan per role

```
Doer:         [RoleDefinition, PartContext, Ticket, PlanMd, PriorPublicMd,
               IterationFeedback, FeedbackItem,
               PublicMdOutputPath, WritingGuidelines, CallbackHelp]

Reviewer:     [RoleDefinition, PartContext, Ticket, PlanMd, PriorPublicMd,
               DoerOutputForReview, StructuredFeedbackFormat,
               AddressedFeedback, RejectedFeedback, RemainingOptionalFeedback,
               FeedbackWritingInstructions,
               PublicMdOutputPath, WritingGuidelines, CallbackHelp]

Planner:      [RoleDefinition, Ticket, RoleCatalog, AvailableAgentTypes,
               PlanFormatInstructions, PlannerFeedback,
               PlanFlowJsonOutputPath, PlanMdOutputPath, PublicMdOutputPath,
               WritingGuidelines, CallbackHelp]

PlanReviewer: [RoleDefinition, Ticket, PlanFlowJsonContent, PlanMdContent,
               AvailableAgentTypes, PlannerPublicMd, PlanReviewerPriorFeedback,
               PublicMdOutputPath, WritingGuidelines, CallbackHelp]
```

### assembleFromPlan

```kotlin
private suspend fun assembleFromPlan(
    plan: List<InstructionSection>,
    request: UnifiedInstructionRequest,
): Path
```

`assembleInstructions` selects the role-specific plan (a `List<InstructionSection>`) by
dispatching on `role`, then delegates to `assembleFromPlan`. Each `InstructionSection` reads
only the fields it needs from `UnifiedInstructionRequest` — conditional sections
(e.g. `IterationFeedback`, `PlanMd`) simply render empty when the condition is false.

### Benefits

- **DRY**: shared sections (`Ticket`, `WritingGuidelines`, `CallbackHelp`, etc.) have exactly one implementation each.
- **Legible structure**: instruction composition is readable as a data list, not scattered across template methods.
- **Extensible**: new section = one new `InstructionSection` subtype; new role = one new `AgentRole` variant + one plan list.
- **Testable**: each `InstructionSection` can be unit-tested in isolation.
- **Simplified call site**: `PartExecutor` calls one method with a `role` parameter — impossible to call the wrong one; no role dispatch at the call site.

---

## Visibility Rules

### Upstream Guarantee: PUBLIC.md Validated Before Assembly

`ContextForAgentProvider` assumes that all referenced `PUBLIC.md` files exist and are
non-empty. This is guaranteed by the executor's PUBLIC.md validation step
(ref.ap.THDW9SHzs1x2JN9YP9OYU.E) — performed after every `done` signal, before the
executor proceeds to assemble the next agent's instructions. The provider does **not**
perform its own existence check — that would be redundant defense-in-depth that masks
upstream bugs.

### Which Prior PUBLIC.md Files Does an Execution Agent See?

**Rule: all completed prior parts' PUBLIC.md files, plus the current part's peer sub-part.**

Concretely, for a sub-part in part N:
- All sub-parts' `PUBLIC.md` from parts 1 through N-1 (completed parts)
- The peer sub-part's `PUBLIC.md` within the same part (if it exists — e.g., reviewer
  sees doer's output, doer on iteration sees reviewer's feedback)
- **NOT** future parts' outputs (they don't exist yet)

This is deterministic from the workflow position. No heuristics, no "relevance" scoring.

### Planning Phase Visibility

- PLAN_REVIEWER sees planner's `PUBLIC.md`
- Planner on iteration sees plan reviewer's `PUBLIC.md`
- Execution agents do **not** see planning phase `PUBLIC.md` files — the plan itself
  (`PLAN.md` in `shared/plan/`) is sufficient context

---

## Structured Reviewer Feedback Contract / ap.EslyJMFQq8BBrFXCzYw5P.E

When a reviewer signals `needs_iteration`, its `PUBLIC.md` should follow a structured format.
Free-form feedback wastes iteration budget — the doer may misinterpret vague critique or
miss actionable items entirely. A structured contract ensures productive iterations.

### Enforcement Boundary

**Harness-enforced:** PUBLIC.md must exist and be non-empty after every `done` signal
(including `needs_iteration`). This is validated by the executor
(ref.ap.THDW9SHzs1x2JN9YP9OYU.E) — missing or empty PUBLIC.md triggers re-instruction,
then hard failure.

**Guidance only (not harness-validated):** The structured format below (## Issues,
## Acceptance Criteria, etc.) is delivered to the reviewer as instruction text. The harness
does **not** parse or validate the markdown structure. This is a deliberate KISS choice —
parsing markdown headings would be fragile and over-engineered for V1. The format is
enforced socially: the doer's instructions reference it, creating a feedback loop.

**Granular feedback items:** In addition to PUBLIC.md, the reviewer writes individual
actionable issues as separate markdown files to `__feedback/pending/` with severity filename
prefixes (`critical__`, `important__`, `optional__`)
(ref.ap.3Hskx3JzhDlixTnvYxclk.E). The harness feeds these to the doer one at a time via
the inner feedback loop. The doer writes a `## Resolution: ADDRESSED`,
`## Resolution: REJECTED`, or `## Resolution: SKIPPED` (optional items only) marker; the
harness reads it and moves the file accordingly. `SKIPPED` is valid only for `optional__`
items — it signals the doer reviewed the item and chose not to act; the harness moves it
to `addressed/`. Rejections trigger a bounded per-item negotiation with the reviewer (at
most 1 round of disagreement). Full spec:
[`granular-feedback-loop.md`](../plan/granular-feedback-loop.md)
(ref.ap.5Y5s8gqykzGN1TVK5MZdS.E).

### Required PUBLIC.md Format on `needs_iteration`

The reviewer's `PUBLIC.md` should include these sections when the verdict is `needs_iteration`:

```markdown
## Verdict: needs_iteration

## Issues
- [ ] <issue-1>: <description> | Severity: must-fix | File(s): <path>
- [ ] <issue-2>: <description> | Severity: should-fix | File(s): <path>

## Acceptance Criteria for Next Iteration
<concrete checklist the doer must satisfy to get a `pass`>

## What Passed (do NOT regress)
<list of things that are good and must be preserved>
```

**Severity levels:**
- `must-fix` — blocks `pass`. The doer must address this or explicitly push back with reasoning.
- `should-fix` — does not block `pass` alone, but multiple pending `should-fix` items may.

The reviewer instructions (assembled by `ContextForAgentProvider`) include this format as
static guidance text, wrapped in `<critical_to_keep_through_compaction>` tags.

On `pass`, the reviewer's `PUBLIC.md` is free-form — a brief summary of what was reviewed
and why it passes is sufficient.

---

## Doer Pushback Guidance — Iteration Feedback

When a doer receives reviewer feedback on iteration > 1, the instruction file includes
**pushback guidance** as static text alongside the reviewer's `PUBLIC.md`. This guidance
is critical because the doer↔reviewer loop is a dialogue where the doer may legitimately
disagree with the reviewer's feedback.

### Why This Matters

A typical multi-part workflow looks like:

```
part_1 (main implementation and review loop) {
  implementor       ← doer
  reviewer           ← reviewer
}
part_2 (single sub-part) {
  reviewer_with_self_fixing  ← final pass
}
```

The part 2 reviewer (or any future agent reading the code) will not have access to the
iteration dialogue between the implementor and reviewer in part 1. If the implementor
silently accepts bad reviewer feedback, the code degrades. If the implementor silently
rejects good feedback, later reviewers will flag the same issues again.

**The solution**: when the doer disagrees with reviewer feedback, it must **defend the
decision in the code itself** — via comments explaining WHY the reviewer's suggestion was
considered and rejected. This creates a durable record that survives beyond the iteration
loop and prevents future reviewers from re-raising the same points.

### Guidance Text (included in doer instructions on iteration > 1)

```markdown
## Handling Reviewer Feedback

You have received feedback from the reviewer. Address each point:

- **If you agree**: implement the requested changes.
- **If you disagree**: you are empowered to push back, but you MUST defend your decision
  with clear reasoning in the code comments and PUBLIC.md.
- **Do NOT push back for the sake of pushing back.** Only reject feedback when you
  genuinely believe the reviewer is incorrect or missing context.
- **Document your reasoning in PUBLIC.md**: for each reviewer point, state whether you
  accepted or rejected it and why. This helps the reviewer on the next pass understand
  your decisions without re-reviewing unchanged code.
- **Document non-obvious decisions and pitfalls in code comments.** When you reject an
  approach or discover a dead end, leave a comment at the code site so future readers
  understand why.
```

This guidance is wrapped in `<critical_to_keep_through_compaction>` tags alongside the
callback script usage to survive context compaction.

---

## Callback Script Help — Compaction Survival

The callback script usage block is wrapped in `<critical_to_keep_through_compaction>` tags:

```markdown
<critical_to_keep_through_compaction>
## Communicating with the Harness

`callback_shepherd.signal.sh` on your $PATH — fire-and-forget signals to the harness.

**Payload ACK — MUST do first when you receive a wrapped payload:**
When you receive input wrapped in `<payload_from_shepherd_must_ack>` XML tags, you MUST
call the command in the `MUST_ACK_BEFORE_PROCEEDING` attribute BEFORE processing the
payload content:
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh ack-payload <payload_id>`
The `payload_id` and exact command are in the XML wrapper — copy it exactly.

When you complete your task:
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh done completed`        (if you are a doer)
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh done pass`             (if you are a reviewer and work passes)
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh done needs_iteration`  (if you are a reviewer and work needs changes)

If you have a question for the human:
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh user-question "Your question here"`
Wait for the answer — it will arrive via your input.

If you hit an unrecoverable error:
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh fail-workflow "Reason for failure"`

Health ping acknowledgment (when asked):
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh ping-ack`
</critical_to_keep_through_compaction>
```

The provider inserts the **correct result value** for the agent's role (doer vs. reviewer)
so the agent doesn't have to figure out which values apply to it. All agents (planning and
execution phase) receive the same compaction-survival block above.

---

## Output Location

Instruction files are written to the sub-part's `comm/in/instructions.md` inside `.ai_out/`:

```
.ai_out/${git_branch}/execution/${part_name}/${sub_part}/comm/in/instructions.md
.ai_out/${git_branch}/planning/${sub_part}/comm/in/instructions.md
```

Instructions are **overwritten** on each iteration — git history preserves prior versions.
This means no cleanup is needed and the full communication is git-tracked alongside agent
outputs (`comm/out/PUBLIC.md`).

The provider writes the file and returns its `Path`. The caller
(`PartExecutor` ref.ap.fFr7GUmCYQEV5SJi8p6AS.E) sends the path to the agent via TMUX `send-keys`.

---

## Ownership and Wiring

- **Created by** `TicketShepherdCreator` (ref.ap.cJbeC4udcM3J8UFoWXfGh.E)
- **Used by** `PartExecutor` (ref.ap.fFr7GUmCYQEV5SJi8p6AS.E) directly during instruction assembly
- **Depends on**: `.ai_out/` directory schema (ref.ap.BXQlLDTec7cVVOrzXWfR7.E) for path resolution

---

## What It Does NOT Do

- **Does not decide which agent to spawn** — that's TicketShepherd walking the workflow
- **Does not send the file to the agent** — that's the `PartExecutor` via TMUX `send-keys`
- **Does not validate PUBLIC.md existence** — guaranteed by executor's upstream validation (ref.ap.THDW9SHzs1x2JN9YP9OYU.E)
