# Context Window Self-Compaction — UseCase / ap.8nwz2AHf503xwq8fKuLcl.E

Detects context window exhaustion in TMUX-powered agents and performs controlled
self-compaction — killing the old session and spawning a fresh one with a `PRIVATE.md`
context summary. Replaces Claude Code's built-in auto-compaction (which is disabled)
with harness-controlled compaction at predictable boundaries.

**Scope: all TMUX-powered sub-parts** — planning (PLANNER, PLAN_REVIEWER) and execution
(doers and reviewers). The logic lives in `PartExecutor` (ref.ap.fFr7GUmCYQEV5SJi8p6AS.E),
which is shared across all part types. No sub-part is exempt.

All agent operations in this use case (send compaction instructions, read context window state,
kill sessions, spawn new sessions) flow through the `AgentFacade` facade
(ref.ap.9h0KS4EOK5yumssRCJdbq.E). `PartExecutor` never accesses `SessionsState`,
`TmuxCommunicator`, or `TmuxSessionManager` directly. This enables unit testing of the full
compaction state machine via `FakeAgentFacade` + virtual time.

---

## Why This Exists

After many doer↔reviewer iterations, the agent's context fills up. Claude Code compacts
automatically, but instructions and accumulated conversation can exceed limits. The agent
degrades silently — it may miss instructions, produce garbage, or loop. The existing health
monitor (ref.ap.6HIM68gd4kb8D2WmvQDUK.E) only checks "alive," not "functional."

**Solution:** Disable Claude Code's auto-compaction entirely. Monitor context window state
via an external hook that writes `context_window_slim.json`. At predictable thresholds,
the harness asks the agent to summarize its context into `PRIVATE.md`, kills the session,
and spawns a fresh one. The new session receives `PRIVATE.md` as part of its instructions —
a clean context window with compressed but complete prior knowledge.

---

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Self-compaction** | Harness-controlled process: agent summarizes context → writes `PRIVATE.md` → signals `self-compacted` → harness kills session → spawns fresh session with `PRIVATE.md`. |
| **context_window_slim.json** | External hook artifact at `${HOME}/.vintrin_env/claude_code/session/<SessionID>/context_window_slim.json`. Written by a hook outside Shepherd after every conversation turn (when the agent stops thinking). Format: `{"remaining_percentage": N, "file_updated_timestamp": "ISO8601"}` where N is 0–100 (100 = fresh, 0 = exhausted) and `file_updated_timestamp` is the ISO 8601 timestamp of when the hook last wrote this file. |
| **Soft threshold** | `remaining_percentage ≤ SELF_COMPACTION_SOFT_THRESHOLD` (default: 35). Triggers when the agent has **used 65%** of its context (35% remaining). Checked at `done` boundaries — proactive compaction while the agent still has room to produce a quality summary. |
| **Hard threshold** | `remaining_percentage ≤ SELF_COMPACTION_HARD_THRESHOLD` (default: 20). Triggers when the agent has **used 80%** of its context (20% remaining). Checked continuously (1-second poll). Triggers emergency mid-task interrupt + forced self-compaction. |
| **Session rotation** | Kill old TMUX session → spawn new one for the same sub-part. New HandshakeGuid, new session record in `sessionIds` array. |
| **PRIVATE.md** | Agent's self-compaction summary. Written to `${sub_part}/private/PRIVATE.md` in `.ai_out/`. Contains compressed but context-rich summary of the agent's work, decisions, and challenges. |

---

## Two Thresholds, Two Flows

### Flow 1: Soft Threshold at Done Boundary (remaining_percentage ≤ 35)

Triggered after `AgentSignal.Done` (any result: `COMPLETED`, `PASS`, `NEEDS_ITERATION`),
after PUBLIC.md validation (ref.ap.THDW9SHzs1x2JN9YP9OYU.E) succeeds.

```
Agent signals done
    │
    ├─ PUBLIC.md validation (existing step)
    │
    ├─ Read context_window_slim.json
    │   ├─ remaining_percentage > SELF_COMPACTION_SOFT_THRESHOLD → continue normal flow (reviewer, next iteration, etc.)
    │   └─ remaining_percentage ≤ SELF_COMPACTION_SOFT_THRESHOLD → self-compaction:
    │       │
    │       ├─ Reset signal via AgentFacade (fresh deferred)
    │       ├─ Send self-compaction instruction via AgentFacade.sendPayloadWithAck()
    │       ├─ Await AgentSignal.SelfCompacted (with timeout)
    │       ├─ Validate PRIVATE.md exists and is non-empty
    │       ├─ Kill session via AgentFacade.killSession()
    │       └─ Mark sub-part as needing respawn (no live session)
    │
    └─ Continue normal flow (GitCommitStrategy, next sub-part, iteration restart)
```

The next time the executor needs this sub-part (e.g., doer on iteration > 1), it detects
no live session and spawns a new one via the standard spawn flow
(ref.ap.hZdTRho3gQwgIXxoUtTqy.E). The new session's instructions include `PRIVATE.md`
via `ContextForAgentProvider` (ref.ap.9HksYVzl1KkR9E1L2x8Tx.E).

### Flow 2: Hard Threshold Mid-Task — Emergency Interrupt (remaining_percentage ≤ 20)

Triggered during the health-aware await loop (ref.ap.QCjutDexa2UBDaKB3jTcF.E) when the
agent is actively working.

```
Health-aware await loop (polling every 1 second)
    │
    ├─ Check: signal arrived? → return signal (normal path)
    │
    ├─ Read context_window_slim.json
    │   ├─ remaining_percentage > 20 → continue await loop
    │   └─ remaining_percentage ≤ 20 → emergency compaction:
    │       │
    │       ├─ Send Ctrl+C via AgentFacade (interrupt agent mid-task)
    │       ├─ Brief pause (1-2 seconds) for interrupt to take effect
    │       ├─ Reset signal via AgentFacade (fresh deferred)
    │       ├─ Send self-compaction instruction via AgentFacade.sendPayloadWithAck()
    │       ├─ Await AgentSignal.SelfCompacted (with timeout)
    │       ├─ Validate PRIVATE.md exists and is non-empty
    │       ├─ Kill session via AgentFacade.killSession()
    │       ├─ Spawn new session via AgentFacade.spawnAgent()
    │       │   (encapsulates standard spawn flow — ref.ap.hZdTRho3gQwgIXxoUtTqy.E)
    │       ├─ New session receives instructions including PRIVATE.md
    │       └─ Enter new health-aware await loop for the new session
    │
    └─ Regular health checks (at normal intervals — ref.ap.6HIM68gd4kb8D2WmvQDUK.E)
```

**Race condition: `done` arrives between detection and interrupt.** The executor checks
if the deferred was completed before sending Ctrl+C. If `Done` arrived, the executor
falls through to the normal done-boundary compaction (Flow 1). No interrupt sent.

---

## ContextWindowStateReader / ap.ufavF1Ztk6vm74dLAgANY.E

Agent-type-specific interface for reading context window state. Follows the same OCP
pattern as `AgentStarter` (ref.ap.RK7bWx3vN8qLfYtJ5dZmQ.E) and `AgentSessionIdResolver`
(ref.ap.D3ICqiFdFFgbFIPLMTYdoyss.E) — one implementation per agent type.

```kotlin
interface ContextWindowStateReader {
    /**
     * Reads the current context window state for an agent session.
     * Throws [ContextWindowStateUnavailableException] if the state file
     * is not present — this is a hard stop failure indicating the
     * external hook is not configured.
     */
    suspend fun read(agentSessionId: String): ContextWindowState

    /**
     * Validates that the context window state file exists for this session.
     * Called after session ID resolution to fail fast on hook misconfiguration.
     */
    suspend fun validatePresence(agentSessionId: String)
}

data class ContextWindowState(
    val remainingPercentage: Int,          // 0–100, 100 = fresh
    val fileUpdatedTimestamp: Instant       // When the hook last wrote this file (ISO 8601)
)
```

### V1 Implementation: ClaudeCodeContextWindowStateReader

Reads from `${HOME}/.vintrin_env/claude_code/session/<agentSessionId>/context_window_slim.json`.

- File missing → `ContextWindowStateUnavailableException` (extends `AsgardBaseException`)
  — **hard stop failure**. Means the external hook is not writing context state.
- File present but malformed → same exception with details.
- `validatePresence()` called after `AgentSessionIdResolver` resolves the session ID
  (step 6a in spawn flow — ref.ap.hZdTRho3gQwgIXxoUtTqy.E). Confirms hook is active
  before any work begins.

### Non-TMUX Agents

`--print` mode agents (via `NonInteractiveAgentRunner` — ref.ap.ad4vG4G2xMPiMHRreoYVr.E)
do not use context window monitoring. They run a single request/response — no iteration,
no context accumulation.

---

## Self-Compacted Signal / ap.HU6KB4uRDmOObD54gdjYs.E

New endpoint and `AgentSignal` variant for self-compaction completion.

### Endpoint

`/callback-shepherd/signal/self-compacted` — **lifecycle signal** (completes the deferred).

- Payload: `{ "handshakeGuid": "handshake.xxx" }` (same as other signals)
- Server behavior: lookup session → complete `signalDeferred` with `AgentSignal.SelfCompacted`
- Updates `lastActivityTimestamp` (ref.ap.igClEuLMC0bn7mDrK41jQ.E)

### AgentSignal Extension

```kotlin
sealed class AgentSignal {
    data class Done(val result: DoneResult) : AgentSignal()
    data class FailWorkflow(val reason: String) : AgentSignal()
    data class Crashed(val details: String) : AgentSignal()
    object SelfCompacted : AgentSignal()  // NEW
}
```

### Callback Script Usage

```bash
# After writing PRIVATE.md during self-compaction:
callback_shepherd.signal.sh self-compacted
```

This is included in the self-compaction instruction (not in the standard callback help
block, since agents don't call it spontaneously — only in response to a harness-initiated
compaction instruction).

### Fallback: Agent Signals `done` Instead of `self-compacted`

If the agent misunderstands the compaction instruction and signals `done` instead of
`self-compacted`, the executor receives `Done`. It should:
1. Check if `PRIVATE.md` was written (the agent may have done the right thing, wrong signal)
2. If `PRIVATE.md` exists → proceed with session rotation (treat as successful compaction)
3. If `PRIVATE.md` missing → re-instruction (one retry, same pattern as PUBLIC.md retry —
   ref.ap.THDW9SHzs1x2JN9YP9OYU.E)

---

## Self-Compaction Instruction Message / ap.kY4yu9B3HGvN66RoDi0Fb.E

Sent to the agent via `AckedPayloadSender` (ref.ap.tbtBcVN2iCl1xfHJthllP.E) when
self-compaction is triggered (either threshold).

### Template

```markdown
Your context window is running low. Summarize this chat into
`<absolute_path_to_private_md>` so work can continue in a new chat.

Preserve all context needed for a new chat to understand:
- What we're doing and why
- At which point we are in the work
- All challenges we've had and how we've solved them
- Key decisions made and why
- Any patterns or discoveries about the codebase

Make the summary as **concise** as possible but context rich.

After writing the file, signal completion:
`callback_shepherd.signal.sh self-compacted`
```

**For emergency interrupt (Flow 2)**, the message is prepended with:

```markdown
You were interrupted because your context window is critically low.
Do NOT continue your previous task. Focus only on writing the summary below.
```

### Compaction Timeout

The agent has **5 minutes** to write `PRIVATE.md` and signal `self-compacted`.
Compaction is a lightweight summarization task — 5 minutes is generous.
If timeout expires → `PartResult.AgentCrashed("Agent failed to self-compact within timeout")`.

---

## PRIVATE.md — Directory Schema Change

### Updated Sub-Part Directory Structure

```
└── ${sub_part}/
    ├── private/
    │   └── PRIVATE.md          # Self-compaction summary (created by agent during compaction)
    └── comm/
        ├── in/
        │   └── instructions.md
        └── out/
            └── PUBLIC.md
```

This updates the `.ai_out/` directory schema (ref.ap.BXQlLDTec7cVVOrzXWfR7.E).

### Previous "No PRIVATE.md" Decision — Superseded

The ai-out directory schema previously stated "No PRIVATE.md" with rationale that an agent's
private state lives in its conversation history. Self-compaction introduces a legitimate
need for persisted private state: when the session is killed and respawned, the conversation
history is gone. `PRIVATE.md` bridges this gap.

### PRIVATE.md Lifecycle

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| First run | `private/PRIVATE.md` does not exist. `ContextForAgentProvider` skips it. |
| Self-compaction triggered | Agent writes `PRIVATE.md`. Git commit captures it. |
| New session spawns | `ContextForAgentProvider` includes `PRIVATE.md` in instructions. |
| Second self-compaction | Agent receives old `PRIVATE.md` in instructions. Writes new `PRIVATE.md` that incorporates the old content. Old version preserved in git history. |
| Part completes | `PRIVATE.md` remains in `.ai_out/` as a historical artifact. |

### What Goes in PRIVATE.md vs PUBLIC.md

| PRIVATE.md | PUBLIC.md |
|---|---|
| Agent's own context continuation — what it was doing, where it was, what it learned | Agent work log — decisions, rationale, review verdicts |
| Challenges encountered and solutions found | What was implemented or reviewed |
| Internal reasoning and dead ends explored | Part-specific trade-offs |
| Only consumed by the same sub-part's next session | Consumed by other sub-parts and agents |

---

## ContextForAgentProvider Change / ref.ap.9HksYVzl1KkR9E1L2x8Tx.E

### New Entry in Instruction Concatenation

`PRIVATE.md` is included in instruction assembly for **all agent types** (execution, planner,
plan-reviewer) when the file exists.

**Position in concatenation order** — inserted between role definition and part context
(high priority, since it contains the agent's own prior knowledge):

| # | Section | Source | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Role definition** | `$TICKET_SHEPHERD_AGENTS_DIR` | Unchanged |
| **1b** | **PRIVATE.md (if exists)** | `${sub_part}/private/PRIVATE.md` | **NEW** — Self-compaction context from prior session. Only present after session rotation. |
| 2 | **Part context** | `current_state.json` | Unchanged |
| 3 | **Ticket** | CLI `--ticket` | Unchanged |
| ... | *(remaining sections unchanged)* | | |

**Inclusion rule:** If `${sub_part}/private/PRIVATE.md` exists and is non-empty, include it.
If it does not exist, skip silently (no error — most sub-parts will never self-compact).

---

## Auto-Compaction Disabled — Prerequisite

### Why Disable Auto-Compaction

Claude Code has built-in auto-compaction that triggers when the context window fills up.
This compaction:
- Happens at unpredictable times
- Loses quality (summarization is automatic, not guided)
- Interferes with our controlled self-compaction

By disabling auto-compaction, the harness becomes the **sole controller** of context
management. Self-compaction happens at predictable thresholds with guided summarization.

### How Auto-Compaction Is Disabled / ap.7bD0uLeoQQSFS16TQeCRF.E

Two mechanisms are required (belt and suspenders):

**1. Config file: `~/.claude.json`** (the **app-state** file) must contain
`"autoCompactEnabled": false`.

Write logic (same as what `ClaudeCodeAgentStarter` must do on every spawn):

```bash
# If file doesn't exist, create it:
echo '{"autoCompactEnabled":false}' > ~/.claude.json

# If file exists, update via jq:
jq '.autoCompactEnabled = false' ~/.claude.json > ~/.claude.json.tmp \
    && mv ~/.claude.json.tmp ~/.claude.json
```

<!-- WHY-NOT(2026-03-14): Do NOT use ~/.claude/settings.json for autoCompactEnabled —
     it silently ignores this key. Only ~/.claude.json (the app-state file) works.
     Ref: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6689 -->

> **`~/.claude/settings.json` silently ignores `autoCompactEnabled`.** Only `~/.claude.json`
> works. This is a known Claude Code behavior
> (ref: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6689).

**2. Env var: `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=true`** must be exported in the TMUX session
environment.

```bash
export DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=true
```

Both are required. The config file persists the setting; the env var is the runtime
enforcement.

### Harness Responsibilities — On Each Agent Start

Auto-compaction must be confirmed disabled **every time** an agent is started — not just
at harness startup. This guards against external processes re-enabling compaction between
agent spawns.

| When | What | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| **Harness startup** | `EnvironmentValidator` (ref.ap.A8WqG9oplNTpsW7YqoIyX.E) reads `~/.claude.json`, parses JSON, verifies `autoCompactEnabled == false`. Hard fail with clear error if the file is missing, unparseable, or `autoCompactEnabled` is not `false`. | `EnvironmentValidator.validate()` |
| **Every agent spawn** | `ClaudeCodeAgentStarter` (ref.ap.RK7bWx3vN8qLfYtJ5dZmQ.E) does **both**: (1) writes `~/.claude.json` with `autoCompactEnabled: false` via `jq` (create if absent, update if present — see bash above), and (2) exports `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=true` in the TMUX session env (alongside `TICKET_SHEPHERD_HANDSHAKE_GUID` and `TICKET_SHEPHERD_SERVER_PORT`). | `ClaudeCodeAgentStarter.buildStartCommand()` |
| **Every session rotation** | Same as above — a rotated session is a new spawn. The `ClaudeCodeAgentStarter.buildStartCommand()` call inherently re-applies both mechanisms. | Implicit — covered by spawn flow |

---

## Health-Aware Await Loop Change / ref.ap.QCjutDexa2UBDaKB3jTcF.E

### Current Loop Structure (Before This Change)

```
while (true) {
    signal = awaitSignalWithTimeout(healthCheckInterval)  // 5 min
    if (signal != null) return signal
    // health checks at 5-minute intervals...
}
```

### Updated Loop Structure

The loop now polls every **1 second** for context window state while maintaining the
existing health check intervals:

```
// Phase B (updated): Signal-Await with Context Window Monitoring
lastHealthCheck = now()
while (true) {
    signal = awaitSignalWithTimeout(1.second)

    if (signal != null) {
        return signal  // Done, FailWorkflow, SelfCompacted
    }

    // --- Context window check (every iteration = every ~1 second) ---
    contextState = agentFacade.readContextWindowState(handle)

    // Stale context guard: don't trust remaining_percentage if the hook hasn't
    // updated recently — the agent may have died and the percentage is frozen.
    // See HealthMonitoring.md Dual-Signal Liveness Model (ref.ap.dnc1m7qKXVw2zJP8yFRE.E).
    contextFileAge = now() - contextState.fileUpdatedTimestamp
    if (contextFileAge <= contextFileStaleTimeout) {
        // Context state is fresh — safe to trust remaining_percentage
        if (contextState.remainingPercentage <= HARD_THRESHOLD) {
            // Check if done already arrived (race condition guard)
            if (signalDeferred.isCompleted) {
                return signalDeferred.await()
            }
            // Emergency compaction
            return handleEmergencyCompaction(sessionEntry)
        }
    } else {
        // Context state is stale — remaining_percentage unreliable.
        // Log warning and skip compaction threshold checks.
        // The dual-signal liveness check (below) will handle detection.
        log.warn("file_updated_timestamp_stale — remaining_percentage unreliable",
            Val(contextFileAge, CONTEXT_FILE_AGE),
            Val(contextFileStaleTimeout, STALENESS_THRESHOLD))
    }

    // --- Regular health checks (at normal intervals) ---
    elapsed = now() - lastHealthCheck
    if (elapsed >= healthCheckInterval) {
        lastHealthCheck = now()
        // existing health check logic (lastActivityTimestamp, ping, etc.)
        ...
    }
}
```

**Key:** The 1-second poll interval applies to `awaitSignalWithTimeout`, NOT to health
checks. Health checks still fire at their normal intervals (5 min default). Context window
state is checked every iteration (~1 second). File I/O overhead is negligible — the file
is a single-line JSON on local filesystem.

---

## Hard Constraint Modification / ref.ap.NAVMACFCbnE7L6Geutwyk.E (high-level.md)

### Before

> **One TMUX session per sub-part.** A sub-part gets exactly one TMUX session, spawned on
> first run and kept alive across iteration loops. The session is killed only when the
> **part** completes.

### After

> **One TMUX session per sub-part at a time.** A sub-part gets exactly one TMUX session,
> spawned on first run and kept alive across iteration loops. The session is killed when the
> **part** completes, or when **self-compaction** triggers session rotation
> (ref.ap.8nwz2AHf503xwq8fKuLcl.E). After session rotation, a new session is spawned for
> the same sub-part. No two sessions are alive simultaneously for the same sub-part.

---

## Impact on PartExecutor — Session Existence Check

### Current Assumption

`DoerReviewerPartExecutor` (ref.ap.mxIc5IOj6qYI7vgLcpQn5.E) distinguishes first run
(step 1a/2a: spawn) from subsequent iterations (step 1b/2b: send-keys to existing session)
by whether a live `SpawnedAgentHandle` exists for the sub-part.

### After Self-Compaction

After session rotation, the session is killed via `AgentFacade.killSession()`. On the
next iteration, the executor detects no live handle and spawns a new session:

```
// Updated re-instruction path (step 1b/2b):
if (liveHandleExists(subPart)) {
    // Existing path: send instructions to live session
    agentFacade.sendPayloadWithAck(handle, instructions)
} else {
    // New path: session was killed (self-compaction or crash)
    // Spawn new session via AgentFacade
    handle = agentFacade.spawnAgent(config)
}
```

All agent operations go through `AgentFacade` (ref.ap.9h0KS4EOK5yumssRCJdbq.E). This
naturally handles both self-compaction (intentional kill) and idle session death
(unintentional kill). The same code path serves both — DRY by design.

**DRY between planning and execution:** The `PartExecutor` is already shared between
planning (PLANNER↔PLAN_REVIEWER) and execution parts. The self-compaction logic lives in
the executor, so it applies to both without duplication.

---

## context_window_slim.json Validation After Session ID Resolution

After `AgentSessionIdResolver` resolves the session ID (step 6a in spawn flow —
ref.ap.hZdTRho3gQwgIXxoUtTqy.E), `AgentFacadeImpl` calls
`contextWindowStateReader.validatePresence(agentSessionId)` internally as part of
`spawnAgent()`.

**Timing:** This runs after `/signal/started` is received. At this point:
- The agent is alive and has processed the bootstrap message
- The session ID is resolved from JSONL artifacts
- The external hook should have written `context_window_slim.json`

**Failure:** If the file does not exist → `ContextWindowStateUnavailableException` →
`PartResult.AgentCrashed("context_window_slim.json not found — external hook not configured")`.

This catches hook misconfiguration early — within 3 minutes of spawn — rather than
discovering it later when we need to read the context state.

---

## Session Rotation Detail

After self-compaction completes (all agent operations via `AgentFacade`
ref.ap.9h0KS4EOK5yumssRCJdbq.E):

1. **Validate PRIVATE.md:** Check `${sub_part}/private/PRIVATE.md` exists and is non-empty.
   If missing after one retry → `PartResult.AgentCrashed`.
2. **Git commit:** `GitCommitStrategy.onSubPartDone` — captures PRIVATE.md + any other
   changes the agent made before compaction.
3. **Kill session:** `agentFacade.killSession(handle)` — internally kills TMUX session
   and cleans up `SessionsState`.
4. **Spawn new session:** `agentFacade.spawnAgent(config)` — encapsulates the standard
   spawn flow (ref.ap.hZdTRho3gQwgIXxoUtTqy.E): new `HandshakeGuid`, new TMUX session,
   bootstrap handshake, session ID resolution + context_window_slim.json validation, new
   entry in `sessionIds` array in `current_state.json`. Returns a fresh `SpawnedAgentHandle`.
5. **Send instructions:** `ContextForAgentProvider` assembles instructions. `PRIVATE.md`
   exists → included in concatenation. Delivered via
   `agentFacade.sendPayloadWithAck(newHandle, instructions)`.
6. **Enter health-aware await loop:** Normal monitoring resumes on the new handle's
   `signal` deferred.

**For Flow 1 (done boundary):** Steps 5–7 happen when the executor next needs this sub-part
(lazy respawn). Not immediately after compaction.

**For Flow 2 (emergency interrupt):** Steps 5–7 happen immediately — the agent was
interrupted mid-task and needs to resume work.

---

## Interaction with Other Use Cases

### Granular Feedback Loop (ref.ap.5Y5s8gqykzGN1TVK5MZdS.E)

The inner feedback loop creates **frequent done boundaries** — one after each feedback item,
and additional boundaries during per-item rejection negotiation. Each done boundary is a
natural soft-compaction checkpoint. This significantly reduces the need for emergency
compaction (hard threshold): the doer processes one item, hits a done boundary, compacts if
needed, then starts fresh on the next item. Without the inner loop, the doer processes ALL
feedback in one go, making mid-task context exhaustion more likely.

**The inner feedback loop makes self-compaction proactive rather than reactive.** See
[`granular-feedback-loop.md`](../plan/granular-feedback-loop.md) for the full spec.

### FailedToConvergeUseCase (ref.ap.RJWVLgUGjO5zAwupNLhA0.E)

If self-compaction is triggered at a done boundary and the iteration budget is also exceeded,
self-compaction takes priority. The agent compacts first, then `FailedToConvergeUseCase`
runs with the compacted state. Rationale: the user decision (continue or abort) should
happen with a healthy agent, not an exhausted one.

### Idle Session Death (V2 — ref.ap doc_v2/idle-session-recovery.md)

Self-compaction and idle-session-recovery share the "respawn sub-part session" pattern.
However, they differ in intent:
- Self-compaction: fresh start with PRIVATE.md (no `--resume`)
- Idle recovery (V2): resume with `--resume <sessionId>` to preserve conversation history

The respawn mechanics (new HandshakeGuid, new session record, spawn flow) are the same.
The difference is `--resume` flag and whether PRIVATE.md exists.

### V2 Resume (ref.ap.LX1GCIjv6LgmM7AJFas20.E)

Self-compaction does NOT use `--resume`. The whole point is a fresh context window.
`--resume` preserves the conversation (and its context usage). These are complementary
strategies:
- Self-compaction: context is filling up → summarize and start fresh
- Resume: harness crashed → restore where we left off

---

## Thresholds — Configuration

### V1: Global Defaults

| Threshold | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `SELF_COMPACTION_SOFT_THRESHOLD` | 35 | Compact at done boundary when `remaining_percentage ≤ 35` (i.e., 65% of context used, 35% remaining) |
| `SELF_COMPACTION_HARD_THRESHOLD` | 20 | Emergency interrupt when `remaining_percentage ≤ 20` (i.e., 80% of context used, 20% remaining) |
| `SELF_COMPACTION_TIMEOUT` | 5 min | Max time for agent to write PRIVATE.md and signal |
| `contextFileStaleTimeout` | 5 min | How old `file_updated_timestamp` can be before `remaining_percentage` is considered unreliable. When stale, compaction threshold checks are skipped and the dual-signal liveness model takes over. **Same parameter** as in HealthMonitoring.md (ref.ap.dnc1m7qKXVw2zJP8yFRE.E) — defined once, used for both stale context guard and dual-signal early ping trigger. |

**Centralized constants:** All threshold values MUST be defined as named constants in a single
location (e.g., `CompactionThresholds` object) — never as magic numbers in the codebase. This
makes tuning easy: one place to adjust, one place to review.

Configured via environment variables or harness config. Not per-sub-part in V1.

## Requirements

### R1: ContextWindowStateReader Interface + ClaudeCode Implementation
- Interface with `read(agentSessionId)` and `validatePresence(agentSessionId)` methods
- `ClaudeCodeContextWindowStateReader` reads from `${HOME}/.vintrin_env/claude_code/session/<agentSessionId>/context_window_slim.json`
- File missing → `ContextWindowStateUnavailableException` (hard stop)
- File malformed → same exception with parse error details
- Verifiable: unit test with fake file; integration test confirming file presence after real Claude Code session

### R2: Auto-Compaction Disabled On Each Agent Start
- Full mechanism spec: ref.ap.7bD0uLeoQQSFS16TQeCRF.E
- `EnvironmentValidator` validates `~/.claude.json` contains `"autoCompactEnabled": false` at harness startup — hard fail if not
- `ClaudeCodeAgentStarter` on **every spawn** (including session rotations): (1) writes `~/.claude.json` with `autoCompactEnabled: false` via `jq` (create if absent, update if present), (2) exports `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=true` in TMUX session env
- NOT `~/.claude/settings.json` — that file silently ignores `autoCompactEnabled` (ref: github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6689)
- Verifiable: startup validation test; integration test confirming Claude Code does not auto-compact

### R3: context_window_slim.json Validation After Session ID Resolution
- After `AgentSessionIdResolver` resolves session ID, call `contextWindowStateReader.validatePresence()`
- Missing file → `PartResult.AgentCrashed` with clear error about hook misconfiguration
- Verifiable: unit test — mock resolver returns ID, mock reader throws → executor returns AgentCrashed

### R4: Health-Aware Await Loop Polls Context State Every 1 Second
- `awaitSignalWithTimeout(1.second)` replaces `awaitSignalWithTimeout(healthCheckInterval)`
- Context window state read on every iteration
- Hard threshold check: `remaining_percentage ≤ 20` → emergency compaction
- Regular health checks still fire at normal intervals (tracked by elapsed time)
- Verifiable: unit test — mock reader returning decreasing values → executor triggers emergency compaction at threshold

### R5: Emergency Compaction (Hard Threshold)
- Send Ctrl+C to TMUX session via `send-keys`
- Brief pause (1-2 seconds) for interrupt to take effect
- Race condition guard: check if `signalDeferred` was completed before interrupting
- Send self-compaction instruction via `AckedPayloadSender`
- Await `AgentSignal.SelfCompacted` within 5-minute timeout
- Validate PRIVATE.md, kill session, spawn new session, send instructions, resume monitoring
- Verifiable: unit test — full emergency compaction sequence with mocked TMUX/reader

### R6: Soft Compaction at Done Boundary
- After `AgentSignal.Done` + PUBLIC.md validation, read context window state
- If `remaining_percentage ≤ SELF_COMPACTION_SOFT_THRESHOLD` (default 35) → send compaction instruction, await SelfCompacted
- Validate PRIVATE.md, kill session (lazy respawn — spawns when sub-part next needed)
- Verifiable: unit test — done signal → low context → compaction → session killed

### R7: Self-Compacted Signal Endpoint
- New endpoint `/callback-shepherd/signal/self-compacted`
- New `AgentSignal.SelfCompacted` variant
- Server completes `signalDeferred` with `SelfCompacted`
- Updates `lastActivityTimestamp`
- Callback script: `callback_shepherd.signal.sh self-compacted`
- Verifiable: unit test — server receives self-compacted → deferred completed correctly

### R8: PRIVATE.md in .ai_out/ Directory Structure
- New path: `${sub_part}/private/PRIVATE.md`
- Created by agent during self-compaction
- Overwritten on subsequent self-compactions (git preserves history)
- `AiOutputStructure` creates `private/` directory alongside `comm/`
- Verifiable: directory creation test

### R9: ContextForAgentProvider Includes PRIVATE.md
- Check for `private/PRIVATE.md` in sub-part directory
- If exists and non-empty → include in instruction assembly at position 1b (after role def, before part context)
- If not exists → skip silently (no error)
- Applies to all instruction assembly methods (execution, planner, plan-reviewer)
- Verifiable: unit test — instructions with/without PRIVATE.md present

### R10: Session Rotation
- After self-compaction: `agentFacade.killSession()` (internally kills TMUX, cleans
  SessionsState), clear handle reference
- Executor's re-instruction path detects no live handle → `agentFacade.spawnAgent()`
- New HandshakeGuid, new session record in `sessionIds` array
- PRIVATE.md picked up by ContextForAgentProvider in new instructions
- Works for both planning and execution parts (DRY via shared PartExecutor)
- Verifiable: unit test via `FakeAgentFacade` — full rotation sequence;
  integration test — real session rotation

### R11: Self-Compaction Instruction Message
- Template includes: PRIVATE.md path, summarization guidelines, signal instruction
- Emergency variant includes interrupt acknowledgment prefix
- Verifiable: template renders correct paths and signal commands

## Implementation Gates

### Gate 1: Foundation — Reader + Validation + Auto-Compaction Off
**Scope:** R1, R2, R3
**What:** ContextWindowStateReader interface + ClaudeCode impl. EnvironmentValidator
checks auto-compaction off. ClaudeCodeAgentStarter exports env var + writes config.
context_window_slim.json validated after session ID resolution.
**Verify:**
- Unit tests: reader parses valid/invalid/missing JSON
- Unit test: startup validation rejects missing/wrong `~/.claude.json`
- Unit test: starter command includes `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=true`
- Integration test: real Claude Code session has context_window_slim.json present
**Proceed when:** Reader reliably reads context state, auto-compaction is confirmed disabled,
presence validation catches missing hook.

### Gate 2: Signal + Directory + Instructions
**Scope:** R7, R8, R9, R11
**What:** New `/signal/self-compacted` endpoint. `private/PRIVATE.md` directory structure.
ContextForAgentProvider includes PRIVATE.md. Self-compaction instruction template.
**Verify:**
- Unit test: server routes self-compacted signal correctly
- Unit test: directory structure includes `private/`
- Unit test: instruction assembly includes PRIVATE.md when present, omits when absent
- Unit test: template renders correct content
**Proceed when:** Signal flows through server → deferred, instructions include PRIVATE.md,
template produces correct messages.

### Gate 3: Soft Compaction (Done Boundary)
**Scope:** R6, R10
**What:** Post-done context check, compaction flow, session rotation (lazy respawn).
**Verify:**
- Unit test: done → low context → compaction instruction → SelfCompacted → session killed
- Unit test: done → healthy context → no compaction (normal flow)
- Unit test: session rotation → next use spawns new session with PRIVATE.md
- Unit test: fallback when agent signals `done` instead of `self-compacted`
**Proceed when:** Full soft compaction + rotation works in unit tests.

### Gate 4: Hard Compaction (Emergency Interrupt)
**Scope:** R4, R5
**What:** 1-second polling loop, emergency Ctrl+C interrupt, mid-task compaction, immediate
respawn.
**Verify:**
- Unit test: polling detects context dropping below threshold
- Unit test: race condition guard — done arrives before interrupt
- Unit test: Ctrl+C sent → compaction instruction → SelfCompacted → rotate → respawn → resume
- Unit test: health checks still fire at normal intervals despite 1-second loop
**Proceed when:** Emergency compaction works reliably in unit tests.

### Gate 5: Integration Validation
**Scope:** All requirements end-to-end
**What:** Integration test with real Claude Code agent confirming full flow.
**Verify:**
- Session spawns with auto-compaction disabled
- context_window_slim.json is present and readable
- Self-compaction can be triggered (may require synthetic context filling)
- Session rotation produces a working new session with PRIVATE.md
**Proceed when:** Full flow works against real Claude Code.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Ctrl+C timing corrupts files** | Agent mid-tool-use when interrupted; files may be partially written | Git commit before compaction captures last-known-good state. Agent's first task in new session can detect and fix corruption via `git status`. |
| **PRIVATE.md quality varies** | Poor summarization → degraded agent performance in new session | Structured prompt template with specific sections. Iterate on template based on real-world results. |
| **1-second polling overhead** | Continuous file reads during entire agent work period | File is ~30 bytes JSON on local filesystem. Measured overhead: negligible (< 0.1ms per read). |
| **Self-compaction itself fails** | Agent at 20% remaining may not have enough context to summarize | 5-minute timeout. If fails → `AgentCrashed` → `FailedToExecutePlanUseCase`. Consider shorter PRIVATE.md template for emergency compaction. |
| **External hook stops writing** | context_window_slim.json stale or missing mid-session | Validation after spawn catches missing files. Stale files (remaining_percentage never changes) → health monitoring's existing timeout eventually fires. |
| **35% remaining triggers too early for some workloads** | Frequent unnecessary self-compactions | Threshold is a centralized constant, easily adjustable. Monitor in practice and tune. Each compaction adds ~2 minutes overhead. |

## Open Questions

1. **Compaction count tracking:** Should `current_state.json` track how many times a sub-part
   self-compacted? Useful for observability and debugging. Low effort — add a
   `compactionCount: Int` field to the sub-part record.

2. **PRIVATE.md includes PUBLIC.md?** Should the self-compaction instruction tell the agent
   to incorporate PUBLIC.md content into PRIVATE.md? Or rely on PUBLIC.md being separately
   preserved and included in instructions? **Recommendation:** PRIVATE.md should be
   self-contained (include key PUBLIC.md content). The agent already has PUBLIC.md in
   context when summarizing, so it will naturally include relevant parts.

3. **Multiple consecutive compactions:** If an agent triggers self-compaction on every
   iteration (e.g., complex task that always fills context), the accumulated PRIVATE.md
   may grow large. Should there be a max compaction count per sub-part?
   **Recommendation:** Not in V1. Monitor and add if needed.
