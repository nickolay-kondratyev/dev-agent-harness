# High-Level Design Decisions

## What is the Harness?

The Kotlin CLI **replaces** the TOP_LEVEL_AGENT Claude session. It:
- Reads a task/ticket
- Orchestrates workflow phases (CLARIFICATION → IMPLEMENTATION → REVIEW → ITERATION)
- Spawns code agents (Claude Code, Droid, etc.) as sub-processes
- Manages file-based communication (PUBLIC.md / PRIVATE.md / SHARED_CONTEXT.md)
- Handles git commits between phases
- Monitors convergence and stopping conditions
- Can call `DirectLLMApi` for its own decisions (not everything is hardcoded Kotlin logic)

## Sub-Agent Invocation

- **Shell out** to CLI tools (`claude`, `droid`, etc.) behind a `CodeAgent` abstraction
- Reason: leverages subscription pricing; abstraction allows swapping implementations
- **Strictly serial** execution for V1 (parallel can be delegated to the agent itself)

## CodeAgent Abstraction (rough)

```
CodeAgent.run(
    instructionFile: Path,       // Markdown file with full instructions
    workingDir: Path,
    publicOutputFile: Path,      // explicit PUBLIC.md path
    privateOutputFile: Path,     // explicit PRIVATE.md path
) -> AgentResult { exitCode, stdout }
```

- Instructions written to **Markdown file** (preserves formatting vs. prompt text)
- `publicOutputFile` / `privateOutputFile` are explicit — no generic `outputFiles` list
- V1: no tool restrictions (allow everything)

## DirectLLMApi

For harness-internal quick tasks (compress ticket title, suggest feature name, etc.):

```
DirectLLMApi.askModel(prompt: String, tier: ModelTier): String

enum ModelTier { QuickCheap, Medium }
```

- Each `ModelTier` maps to a separate API provider (e.g., GLM for quick, GPT for medium)
- Provider is configurable per tier

## User Interaction — REVISED (V1 simplification)

**Prototyped and confirmed:** Kotlin can spawn `claude` (and other CLI agents) in fully
interactive mode via `InteractiveProcessRunner` (`ProcessBuilder` + `/dev/tty` redirect).
The user sees a live `claude` session in their terminal; Kotlin resumes after exit.

**This eliminates the sentinel pattern for V1.** Instead of agents writing
`#QUESTION_FOR_HUMAN:` markers and the harness scanning for them, we simply run agents
interactively — they ask the human directly, the human responds, the agent continues.

- **All agent invocations are interactive** (not just CLARIFICATION)
- Human questions are handled natively by the agent's own UX
- No sentinel scanning, no `SHARED_CONTEXT.md` Q&A loop needed in V1
- `SHARED_CONTEXT.md` is still useful for cross-agent context, but not for Q&A routing

**Caveat:** Must run via `./run.sh` (or `./app/build/install/app/bin/app` directly) —
Gradle's `:app:run` task breaks TTY detection. `run.sh` handles `installDist` + bin invocation.

## File Structure

```
.ai_out/${feature}/${git_branch}/
├── sub-agent/
│   ├── shared/
│   │   ├── SHARED_CONTEXT.md                          # Q&A, cross-cutting context for ALL agents
│   │   └── LOCATIONS_OF_PUBLIC_INFO_FROM_OTHER_AGENTS.txt  # links to all PUBLIC.md files
│   ├── harness/
│   │   └── PRIVATE.md                                 # harness internal state
│   └── ${ROLE}/
│       ├── PUBLIC.md
│       └── PRIVATE.md
```

## Agent Role Definitions

- Each ROLE must have a corresponding Markdown file in `${AGENTS_DIR}/`
- **Fail-fast on startup** if role file is missing (before invoking any models)
- Role file is passed to the invoked agent alongside:
  - `SHARED_CONTEXT.md`
  - `LOCATIONS_OF_PUBLIC_INFO_FROM_OTHER_AGENTS.txt`
  - Phase-specific artifacts

## Workflow Definition — Hybrid (Kotlin + XML)

Core engine in Kotlin; workflow phases defined in XML:

```xml
<workflow name="straightforward">
  <phase name="IMPLEMENTATION" role="IMPLEMENTOR_WITH_SELF_PLAN"
         mode="read-write" />
  <phase name="REVIEW" role="IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEWER"
         mode="read-only" depends-on="IMPLEMENTATION" />
  <iteration over="IMPLEMENTATION,REVIEW" max="4" />
</workflow>
```

## Git Branch / Feature Naming

- Tied to **note tickets**: branch = `{note_ticket_id}_{compressed_title}`
- Harness suggests `${feature}` if not provided
- Uses `DirectLLMApi(QuickCheap)` to compress long titles

## Clarification Phase

- Spawn `claude` (or other agent) in **interactive mode** via `InteractiveProcessRunner`
- User interacts directly with the agent; Kotlin resumes after exit
- **PROTOTYPED AND WORKING** — see `InteractiveProcessRunner.kt`
- On CTRL+C: agent exits (exit code -1 / interrupted=true); Kotlin harness continues
  - No custom signal handling needed — `process.waitFor()` unblocks on child exit

## V1 Scope

1. Single straightforward flow: IMPLEMENTATION_WITH_SELF_PLAN → REVIEW → ITERATION
2. File-based communication (PUBLIC.md / PRIVATE.md) between agents
3. Git commits between phases
4. Convergence check (max iterations)
5. **Interactive agent invocation** — human questions handled by agent directly (no sentinel)
6. `CodeAgent` abstraction (ClaudeCode impl) backed by `InteractiveProcessRunner`
7. `DirectLLMApi` for harness decisions
8. XML workflow definition
